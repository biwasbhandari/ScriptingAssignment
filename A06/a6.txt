In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the web browser, such as clicking a button, pressing a key, or submitting a form. JavaScript allows you to respond to these events by defining event handlers, which are functions that execute when a specific event occurs.
Events in JavaScript are as follows:
Click Event:
	button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Code to execute on click
});
KeyDown event:
	input.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
  // Code to execute when key press
});
Submit Event:
	form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Code to execute on form submission
});
Load Event:
image.addEventListener('load', function() {
  // Code to execute when image is loaded
});
Resize Event:
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
  // Code to execute when window is resized
});
